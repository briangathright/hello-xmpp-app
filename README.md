# TestingGrounds

Note: No longer using as java and scala android versions are working, probably should just delete this sub project at some point as its not in android.

This is where the java implementation of Smack currently resides. Right now you can log in as "awallluc@gmail.com" and choose your gmail as the chat partner. Currently, it can talk to google talk, but two of this client can't talk to eachother (not sure why). Google Talk partner can also respond back. 

You will notice when you login that tons of red text and warnings will pop up (this is what I was telling you about). They are not fatal, but they are very annoying and I haven't figured out how to suppress them. Basically Google Talk sends back packets that don't conform to Smack or XMPP so its telling us this, but we can still talk to it.
